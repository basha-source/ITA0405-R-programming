2. Write a R program to get the details of the
objects in memory


R-PROGRAMMING:

x <- 1:1000
y <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 10)
z <- "Hello, R!"
objects_in_memory <- ls()
cat("Details of objects in memory:\n")
for (obj in objects_in_memory) {
  size <- object.size(get(obj))
  cat("Object:", obj, "- Size:", format(size, units = "auto"), "\n")
}
